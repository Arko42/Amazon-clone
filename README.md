## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

* Node.js (LTS version recommended)
* npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/amazon-clone.git](https://github.com/your-username/amazon-clone.git)
    cd amazon-clone
    ```

2.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd client # or whatever your frontend folder is named
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    ```

3.  **Install backend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd ../server # or whatever your backend folder is named
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in your `server` directory (and `client` if applicable) and add the following:

    **For Backend (`server/.env`):**
    ```
    PORT=5000
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key (if using Stripe)
    # Add any other API keys or sensitive information
    ```

    **For Frontend (`client/.env.local` or similar, depending on your framework):**
    ```
    REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_stripe_public_key (if using Stripe)
    REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
    # Add any other public environment variables
    ```

    **(Replace placeholders with your actual values. Refer to your project structure for specific `.env` file locations.)**

## Usage

1.  **Start the backend server:**
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm start
    # or node server.js
    ```
    The server should be running on `http://localhost:5000` (or your specified port).

2.  **Start the frontend development server:**
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm start
    ```
    This will typically open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

Now you can start interacting with the Amazon clone! Register a new user, browse products, add items to your cart, and proceed to checkout.

## Roadmap

* Implement user reviews and ratings for products.
* Add a robust admin dashboard for managing products, orders, and users.
* Integrate real-time notifications (e.g., for order status updates).
* Enhance search functionality with more filters and sorting options.
* Expand payment gateway options.
* Implement a recommendation engine.

**(Customize this section with your future plans for the project.)**
